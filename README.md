# IE 6200: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics

This repository was created for the course **IE 6200: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics** during my studies at Northeastern University. It contains resources, assignments, and projects related to the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics, essential for engineering and data science applications. The repository primarily features code related to the course project, showcasing my understanding and application of the concepts learned throughout the course. All projects and solutions were **completed by me**.

## Course Overview

IE 6200 focuses on the foundational concepts of probability and statistics, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. Key topics include:

- **Probability Concepts**
  - Events and Sample Space
  - Discrete and Continuous Random Variables
- **Distribution Functions**
  - Probability Density Functions (PDF)
  - Probability Mass Functions (PMF)
  - Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)
  - Moment Generating Functions (MGF)
- **Moments and Expectation**
  - Expected Values
- **Common Probability Distributions**
  - **Discrete Distributions**
    - Binomial
    - Poisson
    - Geometric
  - **Continuous Distributions**
    - Uniform
    - Exponential
    - Normal
- **Multivariate Distributions**
  - Covariance
  - Independence of Random Variables
- **Sampling and Descriptive Statistics**
- **Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing**
  - Confidence Intervals
  - Hypothesis Tests
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

This course also requires a solid understanding of multivariate calculus, which is applied throughout various topics.

## Project Overview: Bluebikes

One of the primary projects in this course focuses on analyzing the Bluebikes data. This project utilizes various statistical methods to understand usage patterns, predict demand, and evaluate the factors influencing bike-sharing behaviors in urban environments. The code includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights from the [dataset](https://bluebikes.com/system-data).
