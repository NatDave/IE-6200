# Analysis of Boston's BlueBikes trip dataset

## Course Overview
This repository was originally created for the course **IE 6200: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics** during my PhD at Northeastern University. IE 6200 covers essential probability and statistics concepts, including probability events, random variables, and distribution functions like PDFs, PMFs, and CDFs. Key distributions include binomial, Poisson, (hyper)geometric, uniform, exponential, gamma, and (log)normal. The course also explores multivariate distributions, sampling, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and ANOVA. A strong understanding of multivariate calculus was necessary for these topics.

## Project Overview: Bluebikes
In this course, I worked on a project that focused on analyzing the Bluebikes data. This project utilizes various statistical methods to understand usage patterns, predict demand, and evaluate the factors influencing bike-sharing behaviors in urban environments. The code includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights from the [dataset](https://bluebikes.com/system-data).
