# Analysis of Boston's BlueBikes trip dataset

## Course Overview
This repository was originally created for the course **IE 6200: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics** during my PhD at Northeastern University. IE 6200 covers essential probability and statistics concepts, including probability events, random variables, and distribution functions like PDFs, PMFs, and CDFs. Key distributions include binomial, Poisson, (hyper)geometric, uniform, exponential, gamma, and (log)normal. The course also explores multivariate distributions, sampling, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and ANOVA. A strong understanding of multivariate calculus was necessary for these topics.

## Project Overview: Bluebikes
In this course, I worked on a project that focused on evaluating the impact of e-bike integration on BlueBikes ridership patterns in Boston over a 12-month period. By leveraging machine learning and Google Street View data, the analysis compares key metrics such as usage patterns, trip distances, and travel times between classic bikes and e-bikes. The goal is to understand how e-bikes influence rider behavior, overall demand, and operational challenges within the BlueBikes system. The dataset can be found [here](https://bluebikes.com/system-data).
