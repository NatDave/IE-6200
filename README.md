# Analysis of Boston's BlueBikes trip dataset

## Course Overview
This repository was originally created for the course **IE 6200: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics** during my PhD at Northeastern University. IE 6200 covers essential probability and statistics concepts, including probability events, random variables, and distribution functions like PDFs, PMFs, and CDFs. Key distributions include binomial, Poisson, (hyper)geometric, uniform, exponential, gamma, and (log)normal. The course also explores multivariate distributions, sampling, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and ANOVA. A strong understanding of multivariate calculus was necessary for these topics.

## Project Overview: Bluebikes
In this course, I worked on a project that focused on analyzing the Bluebikes data. This project analyzes how electric bikes have influenced the Bluebikes bike-sharing system in Boston over a 12-month period. The study examines differences in usage patterns, trip distances, and travel times between classic bikes and e-bikes. By comparing these key metrics, we aim to understand how e-bikes impact rider behavior, overall demand, and operational challenges within the system. The dataset can be found [here](https://bluebikes.com/system-data).
